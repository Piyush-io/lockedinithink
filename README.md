# Getting Back to Code

A collection of small projects for re-learning programming fundamentals.

## Projects

- **rusty-ray-tracer**: A Rust-based ray tracer implementation.
- **shellinc.cpp**: A C++ shell implementation.

## Guidelines

1. All code is written manually without AI assistance.
2. Implementations are based on conceptual understanding and handwritten notes from tutorials and articles.

## Status

Started: December 2025
Status: Active, expect force-pushes and dead branches
